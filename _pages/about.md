About me
======

I am a researcher in the Plitzko [CryoEM Technology Research Group](https://www.biochem.mpg.de/plitzko) at the [MPI of Biochemistry](https://www.biochem.mpg.de/en) in a shared project with the Beck [Department for Molecular Sociology](https://www.biophys.mpg.de/molecular-sociology) at the [MPI of Biophysics](https://www.biophys.mpg.de/en) working cryo-FIB development for in situ structural biology. The aim is to enable structural biology  in cells and tissues including prominent developmental biology model systems such as _D. melanogaster_ egg chamber, _A. thaliana_ root tips, and _C. elegans_ larvae.  Biologically, I am very interested in nuclear pore complex structure and function for nucleocytoplasmic transport of large macromolecular complexes and their differences across cell types, as well as protein complexes involved in membrane remodelling such as [VIPP1](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2021.05.011). 


Structural Developmental Biology
======

By deploying and improving the techniques and workflows available in cryo-focused ion beam and [cryo-lift-out](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/microscopy-today/article/recent-advances-in-gas-injection-systemfree-cryofib-liftout-transfer-for-cryoelectron-tomography-of-multicellular-organisms-and-tissues/53E42EB56650CC198B81EDD6FE638419), we have been pushing cryo-ET into multicellular organisms and tissues to enable answering novel biological questions that require the molecular resolution of cryo-ET as well as to use the techniques as an exploratory tool. Recent advances in lift-out technology in a [collaborative work](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.04.28.538734v1) with Oda Schioetz and Christoph Kaiser represents a coming-of-age of cryo-lift-out exploiting improved hardware stability with the methodological lessons learnt on cryogenic micromanipulation and, especially, FIB-based redeposition attachments.


Modular FIB automation across microscope vendors
======

I have been developing and maintaining the software package [SerialFIB](https://github.com/sklumpe/SerialFIB), a modular plaftform for automated cryo-FIB sample preparation, which is currently available for Thermo Fisher Scientific small dual beam instruments (e.g. Scios, Quanta, Aquilos 1 and 2) and newer generation PFIBs (Hydra, Arctis) as well as Zeiss CrossBeam instruments (e.g. 550). Drivers for TESCAN instruments are currently in development. Additionally, I have been starting to deploy machine learning algorithms to allow for a fully automated sample preparation workflow exploiting the potential of sample exchange hardware (AutoLoader) introduced to the next generation of cryo-PFIB instruments.
